# OSIE: Open Source Inventory Entry

A stub for an open source inventory entry application, enabling small businesses and private individuals to quickly enter information about physical items into any inventory management system. Books, clothes, furniture; photos,  dimensions,  descriptions: this app is focused on doing this single task of inputting this information accurately, quickly, and pleasurably.
